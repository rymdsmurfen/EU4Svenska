These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in far away ports. We must not take these traders for granted however.

Insurgency after insurgency will spring up in their path, and Ireland shall never truly be theirs. And, as they sail from our lands, we shall further influence resistance against the protestant imperialists to on our eastern flank."

 tracee_italienne_desc: "The arrival of the cannon has changed the battlefields and sieges of Italy forever and our old medieval fortifications are no longer quite up to the task. Italian engineers have recently pioneered a new style of fortresses with thick earthen ramparts and ditches. Instead of maintaining our outdated walls we should build such fortifications as they are more suited to modern warfare."

The shrines to the Prophet and his Companions lay a mockery to the wise words of Abu Bakr.  Those who worship at these shrines are guilty of shirk, of exalting Man to the level of praise only Allah is due.

All the varied principalities and hill tribes will now heed our call."

After the Malla Kings fell, this tradition continued onwards with other dynasties in Nepal. Let us anoint a new Kumari to inspire our people!"
 gurkha_recruits: " The Gurkhas"
 gurkha_recruits_desc: "The Gurkhas are a tribal people mainly from the mid-western and eastern Nepali hills. They are fierce fighters and we have found that including them as irregulars with our armies brings us great success on the battlefield. Their name derives from the Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath, and their war cry is \"Jaya Mahakali, Ayo Gorkhali!\" (Glory to Great Kali, The Gurkhas approach!)

 reconquista_of_the_sea_desc: "In our frequent clashes with the dreaded corsairs of the Turkish and Barbary menaces, the thought has occurred to us that the corsairs might have the right idea about seagoing looting and pillaging of the coast, but that they are directing their predations to the wrong targets.  Piracy may be a vile sin in peacetime, but in times of war it's known as 'privateering' and that's surely another thing altogether, right?"
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom: "Ecumenical Defenders of Christendom."
 ecumenical_defenders_of_christendom_desc: "The Reformation has harmed our cause as German and Scandinavian knights have started murmuring questions about the nature of the Communion Host, but the always-present threat of the Turk has a way of making such disputes seem minor.  Perhaps we should focus on defending the realm and debate theology once the Saracen threat is safely at bay?"

 triangle_trade: "The Triangle Trade"
 triangle_trade_desc: "The triangle trade brings guns to us, takes slaves from us to the Americas, and brings agricultural goods from the Americas back to Europe.  Those guns allow us to conquer more rival tribes and gain even more captives to sell to the Europeans to give us the funds to buy even more guns!  Some have said that the triangle trade is immoral, but they'll change their tune when they see our new muskets and how many more slaves we can capture with them and how many more muskets we can purchase with the proceeds."

 foreign_demand_for_slaves_desc: "Every once in a while, a disquieting report surfaces that overzealous Europeans have kidnapped one of our noblemen and sent him to a fate worse than death, a horrifying voyage in shackles and a short, gruesome life in a sugar plantation.  Let's take steps to keep the Europeans satisfied with our supply of foreign captives to keep our own people safe from the horrors of slavery.  If we keep conducting these slave raids on the other tribes of Africa, it will keep our own people safe and bring in the revenue to keep our kingdom strong and our own people out of the chains."

Some of our vassals have sensed blood in the water and used our period of weakness in the early 15th century to end all pretense of vassaldom.  We must first remind them of the Mansa's rightful authority if we want our Empire to regain its former glory."

 gold_of_bure_desc: "The twin gold fields at Bambuk and Bure are renowned as the largest gold deposits anyone has ever heard of, and they are ours.  Bure goldmines produce fantastic wealth that famously destabilized the entire economy of Egypt through inflation when Mansa Musa visited there.  Our economy, though, is used to a constant influx of gold and is more difficult to inflate."

 reclamation_of_land_desc: "The Sahara doesn't stay in one place...it can wax and wane depending on rainfall, and the habitable belt known as the Sahel we reside in can grow or shrink accordingly.  A major drought could render much of our kingdom useless desert, an addition to the Sahara where no one reigns but death.

 lost_fleet_of_abubukari_ii_desc: "Around 1312, the Mansa Abubakari II left his throne to sail on an exploration for the limits of the ocean.  Neither he nor his fleet were ever seen again, much to the relief of his successor, Mansa Musa.  As Abubakari once thought, perhaps there is value to seeing the limits of the ocean.  Unlike when he tried it, though, this time the Mansa will stay home."

 seek_new_markets_for_salt_desc: "In our kingdom, salt is worth its price in gold.  South of us, in the great forests of the Ashanti and the Yoruba, salt is worth considerably more than gold.  Luckily for us, we have our own supplies of salt and enough gold to obtain an endless supply of it.  Perhaps we could find yet more markets of people for whom salt is more valuable than gold?"
 west_african_slave_trade: "West African Slave Trade"
 west_african_slave_trade_desc: "Even before our Empire existed, the great Wagadou, the Ghanan Empire that preceded us, sold slaves across the desert to the Arabs, and we have followed suit all these years, supplying the Arab world with a vast amount of slaves.  Now the Europeans clamor for a yet greater number of slaves to work in their holdings in the so-called New World.  We've had little report, but the amount of slaves they demand is truly stunning and they keep coming back, sometimes even raiding our shores and abducting our subjects.  The time has come to impose order on the slave trade and restrict the Europeans to select commercial ports where they will purchase, not steal, slaves."
